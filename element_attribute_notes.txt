    Notes:
        - The HTML <form> element represents a document section containing interactive controls for submitting information.
        - In other words, it provides an area of your webpage to accept user inputted information and submit it to some backend server.
        - I used the form element for a job application section of my website.

    Notes:
        - The HTML <input> element is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user; a wide variety of types of input data and control widgets are available, depending on the device and user agent. 
        - The <input> element is one of the most powerful and complex in all of HTML due to the sheer number of combinations of input types and attributes.
        - Two of the attributes I will be presenting are related to the input element: type, required.

    Notes:
        - The HTML <button> element represents a clickable button, used to submit forms or anywhere in a document for accessible, standard button functionality.
        - The third attribute I'm presenting is related to the button element: value.
