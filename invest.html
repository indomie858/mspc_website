            <p>As you can see in the chart of quarterly earnings reports by sector, many reports are being written and submitted by companies in every sector. That requires paper, which we sell, and something to print or write with, which we also sell. That is crazy market potential for our company to capitalize on. Every industry NEEDS paper. We provide paper. Enough said. Boom mic drop. <br>-Michael Scott</p>
