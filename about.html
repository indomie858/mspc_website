                    <td>Michael Gary Scott has over 15 years of experience in the paper industry. Scott began his career
                        as
                        as a salesman at Dunder-Mifflin. After impressing the leadership team with his sales abilities,
                        Scott was promoted to Regional Manager of Dunder-Mifflin Scranton. After being promoted to a
                        regional manager at a young age, he continued to treat work-related relationships as personal
                        friendships. Michael Scott acknowledges the difficulty because his colleagues are all lower than
                        him
                        in the workplace's hierarchy. Despite his ineptitude, Michael is prone to brief bouts of
                        surprising
                        insight and is shown to have a kind heart as he shows deep, family-like affection towards the
                        people
                        working in the Scranton branch. The staff initially finds Michael annoying but he grows on them
                        and
                        is given emotional goodbyes during his final days in Scranton.</td>

                        the
                        Michael Scott Paper Company, Halpert was the lead receptionist at Dunder-Mifflin Scranton.
                        Originally meek and passive, Pam Halpert grew more assertive as the years passed, prompting her
                        to
                        reassess her career and life goals. From her years working the front desk, Pam has become
                        well-acquainted with the Dunder-Mifflin staff and is consistently shown to have a thorough
                        understanding of her coworkers' personalities, including the more eccentric individuals Dwight
                        Schrute and Michael Scott. She uses this familiarity to manipulate them, often for their and the
                        company's best interests &#40;such as her giving the staff elaborate instructions on how to
                        handle a
                        heartbroken Michael&#41; but also occasionally for her own.</td>

                        from the University of Scranton's Kania School of Management. His
                        dream is to one day own his own business. Ryan Howard started his
                        career as an office temp at Dunder-Mifflin. He earned the nickname
                        &quot;<em>Fire Guy</em>&quot; for starting a small fire when he
                        overcooked his cheese pita in the toaster oven. Ryan Howard worked
                        his way up through the ranks, and later became a Vice President,
                        North East Region and Director of New Media at Dunder-Mifflin. Ryan
                        has encountered some minor setbacks. He was criminally charged and
                        later terminated for misleading Dunder-Mifflin's shareholders via his
                        website's sales numbers, effectively committing fraud. Prior to joining our team, Ryan was a
                        bowling
                        alley employee. Now, Ryan Howard is an integral part of the Michael Scott Paper Company as our

                        to step down after helping his boss illegally pass a drug test. He resides on his family's beet
                        farm with his cousin Mose. Dwight has affinities for paintball, Battlestar Galactica, ping pong,
                        survivalism, karate and weapons. He also prefers to ride in the back of the car, behind the
                        driver, as he believes this is the safest location in a car.</td>
